Currently there are 795388 Lines in the pedComponentVariations.JSON file.
After splitting male and female I have somehow lost 109176 lines, So perhaps some validation checks may be needed.

This is just to help save time, you would need to create files/folders as needed - It can be better optimised, However it does the job currently.

If you would like to optimise, Feel free to throw a PR, Merge request in.

Thanks for using.
