Currently there are 795388 Lines in the pedComponentVariations.JSON file provided from DurtyFree#3216.
If you do not already have the clothing files, You are able too purchase them from him here: https://forge.plebmasters.de/

After splitting male and female clothing, I have somehow lost 109176 lines from the original file, So perhaps some validation checks may be needed.
However the original file is not deleted, so it isn't a loss in data.

This is just to help you save time, if you are slightly OCD like myself and prefer stuff to be neatly accessible.
You would need to create files/folders as needed, and also amend the file paths in the script. - It can be better optimised, However it does the job...

If you would like to optimise, Feel free to throw a PR up.

Thanks for using.
